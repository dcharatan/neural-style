# CSCI 1290 Final Project: Neural Style

## Running the Code

All of the scripts can be found in `source/script_modules`. To run a script, `cd` into the project root directory and run it as a Python module. For example:

```
python3 -m source.script_modules.train_model
```

## Project Setup

### Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, run `python3 -m venv venv`. Then, do `source venv/bin/activate` (or equivalent) and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the project's dependencies.
