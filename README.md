For our final project, we implemented style transfer based on [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer
and Super-Resolution](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/eccv16/) by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi and Fei-Fei Li and the [fast-neural-style-pytorch](https://github.com/rrmina/fast-neural-style-pytorch) repository.

## Running the Code

All of the scripts can be found in `source/script_modules`. To run a script, `cd` into the project root directory and run it as a Python module. For example:

```
python3 -m source.script_modules.train_model --file_name <settings.json>
```

Several settings files can be found in the `settings` folder.

## Project Setup

### Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, run `python3 -m venv venv`. Then, do `source venv/bin/activate` (or equivalent) and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the project's dependencies.
